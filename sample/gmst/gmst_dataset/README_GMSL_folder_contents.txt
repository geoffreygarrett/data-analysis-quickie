Global Mean Sea Level Data and FigureThis folder contains Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) data and figure produced by Brian Beckley from SGT, Inc. at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and funded by NASA MEaSUREs.  The GMSL was generated using the Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_ALL_V2).  It combines Sea Surface Heights from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2 with all biases and corrections applied and placed onto a georeferenced orbit.  This creates a consistent data record throughout time, regardless of the instrument used.The data can be found in GMSL_TPJAOS_199209_201411.txt.  The figure, GMSL_TPJAOS_199209_201301.tif, was generated using the GMSL data with the 60-day Gaussian type filter and had Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) applied.If you use these data please cite:Beckley, B.; Zelensky, N.P.; Holmes, S.A.;Lemoine, F.G.; Ray, R.D.; Mitchum, G.T.; Desai, S.; Brown, S.T.. 2016.
